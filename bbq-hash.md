Dear BBQ Friend:

BBQ Hash is one of those regional specialties that varies greatly within the "hash belt" which is mainly South Carolina and Georgia along the South Carolina border. Sconyer's is actually in Augusta, GA which is real bbq hash recipeclose to South Carolina. Sconyer's hash is considered by a lot of people to be the best of the best. I'm sure a lot of people would disagree - preferring their own regional variety. Hash reminds me a lot of the Brunswick Stew they make at our local BBQ joint here in Savannah but there's more tomatoes and chunks of vegetables in Brunswick Stew.

BBQ Hash can vary from a thick soup or stew with lots of vegetable chunks to a Sconyer's style thick, meaty sauce that will sit on top of rice nicely. That's what I'm going to show you how to cook in this recipe. I'm pretty sure BBQ hash originated as a way to use up all the leftover parts of the pig and chicken as it was originally made with hearts, livers, gizzards, heads, etc. But today, they supposedly use all the best ingredients. It can also be made with many different types of meats including but not limited to pork, chicken, beef, and turkey. Sconyer's BBQ hash is traditionally served over rice.

To make things easy because of the long cooking time, I used a 7 qt crock pot. Depending on how much you want to make, you can use your big pot outside on a gas burner or better yet on an open fire. I guess you can also cook it alongside your BBQ on your next smoking session to get some extra smoke flavor infused into your hash. Traditionally, it is cooked in a huge cast iron pot over an outdoor fire.bbq hash

You can start with raw meat or already smoked meat too. Save up those rib tip trimmings and chicken and brisket trimmings too. You can just boil these trimmings until tender and then chop or grind up the cooked meat and reserve some of the liquid for your hash. Better yet, just smoke the trimmings on your smoker till done. Or you can use up all that leftover smoked meat from BBQ contests and Thanksgiving turkeys and make your hash from that. So, here's the recipe (scale up if needed)...

BBQ Hash:

About 2 lb smoked pulled pork

About 2 lb smoked briskethandheld blender

(Note: You can also use smoked chicken or even turkey. What I did with this recipe was use pork and beef and then I used chicken broth for the chicken flavor. Maybe you might want to use pork and chicken and beef broth for flavor. Or use all 3 or 4 meats together with whatever broth you like. Use whatever you got. As a general rule, fill the crock pot up about half way with meat and then just cover with an equal amount of broth.)
You can chop your meat up finely or run it through a meat grinder.

1 large onion chopped fine

4 medium baking potatoes diced (Paleo Substitution â€“ use sweet potatoes or turnips or rutabaga (swedes) or jicama)

1  14-16 oz can of diced tomatoes

64 oz of chicken broth

1 tsp cayenne pepper

1 tsp black pepper

2 tsp salt to taste (optional - there's salt in the chicken broth)

2 tsp minced garlic

Combine all ingredients except the spices and cook on high, covered for 10 hours. Stir every 2-3 hours. For the last two hours of the 12 hour cook, add the spices, stir, and remove the lid to let it thicken up. When finished, use one of those "boat motor" handheld blenders to grind everything up into a thick sauce that will sit on top of rice. You now have Sconyer's style BBQ hash!
